cleaning.py → produces moods_cleaned.csv

load_db.py → loads facts into SQLite

features.ipynb / analysis.R → built features & models

Raw data is cleaned in Python, stored normalized in SQL, and enriched analytically downstream.

'Activities' are derived features generated in the analysis pipeline and therefore not stored in the database.
